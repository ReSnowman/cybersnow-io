## // IDENTITY CONFIRMED

I am a System Administrator currently working within an MSP environment, specializing in network security, automation, and enterprise infrastructure. 

I built this site to serve as a living portfolio of my technical documentation and a log of my ongoing security research.

### Certifications & Training
* **Active:** CompTIA CySA+
* **In Progress:** WatchGuard Fireware Essentials

### Current Operations
Beyond enterprise administration, I maintain an active home lab environment to test deployments before pushing them to production. My current lab stack includes a Raspberry Pi running DietPi, configured with an AdGuard Home DNS sinkhole and a Heimdall dashboard. 

When I am not deep in firewall logs or studying for my next certification, I am usually upgrading my PC gaming rig, running raids in WoW, or dropping into Valorant.
